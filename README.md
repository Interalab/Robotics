# 🚗 Wall•e Wall•e - Smart Interactive Car  
### Voice & Gesture Controlled Autonomous Vehicle  

## 🧠 Overview  
**Smart Interactive Car** is an intelligent robotic vehicle that allows users to control movement through **voice commands** or **hand gestures**.  
By combining **AI-powered speech processing**, **real-time gesture recognition**, and **embedded motor control**, the system enables natural and intuitive human-machine interaction with ElevenLabs and Gemini API.

This project demonstrates the potential of **multimodal AI interaction** in robotics, smart mobility, and assistive technology.
